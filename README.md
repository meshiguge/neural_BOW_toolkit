##Acknowledgements
Three projects help us a lot. The first is the work from Mesnil et al in 2015 ICLR workshop. They implement Paragraph Vector model in C at https://github.com/mesnilgr/iclr15. Another is the work done by Li et al. in 2016 ICLR workshop. They implement n-gram Paragraph Vector model in JAVA at https://github.com/libofang/DV-ngram. The last is the work from Wang and Manning. They propose the NBSVM and publish their code at https://github.com/sidaw/nbsvm. In fact, our models are the neural counterparts of NBSVM. We use the exactly the same datasets with NBSVM.
